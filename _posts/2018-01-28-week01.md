<what do YOU think about when you hear the term "open source"? 
what are some advantages of open vs. closed source
what are some potential problems with open source?>

## Open Source
To me, open source software is indicative of community and collaboration, also that it is probably free. 

## Projects
- Ubuntu: Ubuntu is an open source linux based operating system. I use it as my primary OS, dualbooting it along side Windows. Ubuntu and Linux in general is more convenient than Windows for programming, as working with the terminal is more integral. It's also more lightweight as an operating system. Alternatives would be Windows or macOS. 
- Firefox: Firefox is a web browser developed by Mozilla. Prior to switching to Chrome, this was my primary browser. This was because I had a better time adding extensions and customizing my experience. I won't lie, it's also because Internet Explorer was really stigmatized. Alternatives would be Internet Explorer (i.e. Microsoft Edge) or Chrome.
- VLC media player: VLC media player is a media player. It's great for watching downloaded videos. I use it on my Mac desktop to watch downloaded movies I couldn't find on Netflix. Alternatives would be RealPlayer or DivX.
- Eclipse: Eclipse is an integrated development environment, used primarily with Java. Starting college, Eclipse was my Java IDE of choice. I have since switched to JetBrain's IntelliJ IDEA after Reddit recommended it. Alternatives would be NetBeans or IntelliJ IDEA.

## Questions for Tom
- How did you hurt your shoulder last Saturday?
- How would the net neutrality repeal affect open source software? Do you think this would be a benefit, or a detriment, to Red Hat as a company that profits from open source software?
- As an open source operating system, does Red Hat collaborate with other open source operating systems, such as Ubuntu?

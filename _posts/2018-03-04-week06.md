## Team Stuff
### Strengths and Weaknesses
#### Strengths
We all know javascript, which is nice. We work well together, and we joke well together. Also we're some pretty intelligent people if I do say so myself.

#### Weaknesses
We may joke too much to be honest. Also sometimes not everyone is active at the same time in our chats. I'm sure this will be fixed when we start meeting.

### Meeting times
- Wednesday 5-7pm 
#### Alternative Time
- Saturdays 4-6pm.

### Milestones
- Download and use PDF.js
- Complete online walkthrough
- Clone the repo to get the code
- Learn how to build the app
- Learn style guides, and check what function are already implemented
- Checkout the issues on GitHub, and the IRC
- Triage issues, and try to replicate them
- work on the beginner bugs
- Try to add to the conversation, and work our way up to bigger issues

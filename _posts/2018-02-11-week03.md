## Contributing to Wikipedia

Wikipedia is an absolutely massive resource, containing almost everything, with contributions coming from almost everyone. So if finding an article to contribute to is hard, finding something to contribute is even harder. I realized that contributing to something technical is basically hopeless, as most of what I have learned from college comes directly from Wikipedia, thus I looked towards what I did for entertainment. Specifically, I looked towards Reddit. Even more specifically, I looked to a subreddit that I *occasionally* browse for jeans (please help me). Based on this I decided to contribute to Wikipedia's page on denim. I knew the specific name of the pretreating process used for typical washed denim, and I noticed that it wasn't specifically mentioned on the page, so my contribution was it's inclusion. 

You can find my contribution [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/KeepItRealCatfish).

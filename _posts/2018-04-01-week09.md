## Questions for Danna
- How much does Google value open source in their day-to-day operation?
- Given the inception of DuckDuckGo any push for open source or open data? 
- What in your opinion are the dangers of open source?

## Progress
Dora, Ola, and Ashley are working on looking at the code to understand the code structure better. Suyasha is looking for possible issues for us to work on because she already examined the code base. I am currently actively triaging issues in the project, as well as reviewing closed issues that seem similar to issues that are currently open. As the only one with a laptop with Linux, I am in charge of triaging issues that are os specific.

## Contributions for this Week
I commented on an iOS issue in PDF.js, as well as commenting on an issue on the course website. I also 
submitted a pull request for issue 94, an issue that was assigned to me regarding a typo in the 
course schedule.

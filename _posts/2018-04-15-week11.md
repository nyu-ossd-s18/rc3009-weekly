## Team Progress
We communicated on discord with the members of Terasology for clarification on the issue that we are currently working on.
We decided to try to implement snow and potentially a snow like biome in the game. Suyasha and Dora have created the sprites for th
for the blocks that would be used for snow and snow slabs (half blocks). We found out that there was previously an attempt
to implement weather in the game in the Weather Module, but rain was not functional. I found out from discord that the module
had long been in disuse, so it looks like we'll have to figure out how to implement rain before we implement snow.

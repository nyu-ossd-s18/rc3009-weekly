## The Difference Between the Cathedral model and the Bazaar Model
The difference between the cathedral model and the bazaar model is the way people structure their ideas, and the way they collaborate. The cathedral method is more formulaic. Developers have an idea of what they are creating, and how to create it. There is not as much room for crazy ideas or divergence from the initial design. I associate this model with commercial development, as a client has an expectation of what a product will do and what it will look like. The bazaar model represents a near opposite. Unlike a serene cathedral, a bazaar would be buzzing with constant noise, the ideas of an incredibly diverse group of people. Any one persons voice can have as much gravity as anothers if their idea is solid. Projects following the bazaar model are constantly growing and evolving, rather than developing towards a specific goal. Ideas can constantly shift, or develop, or even be abandoned at a moments notice. 

I would prefer to work in a bazaar environment, where everyone builds things collaboratively. In this way any ideas that I have could be implemented, and if they are good ideas, they could take off. Anyone could take the idea and run with it, debugging it, making it more efficient, or implementing it elsewhere. Good ideas can expand and blossom in a way that a person with one perspective could never cause. Bazaars are not bound by the bias of being in one organization. Bad ideas, on the other hand, can pass with a whimper, and not have any major negative effects. In a bazaar, because no one is working in teams working on specific things, everyone ends up looking at everything. It is that sense of constant and diverse peer review that makes bazaars so special, and makes them preferably to me to work and learn in.
